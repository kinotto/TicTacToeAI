  var tictactoe = require('tictactoe');
  ```
  
  ```javascript
  var emptyBoard = new tictactoe.TicTacToeBoard(['','','','','','','','','']);
  aiPlayer = new tictactoe.TicTacToeAIPlayer();
  aiPlayer.initialize("O", emptyBoard);
  var move = aiPlayer.makeMove();
  if(move != null){
    board.makeMove(aiTeam, move);
  }
  console.log(board.state)
  ```

  import the script:
  

  ```html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/tictactoe/dist/tictactoe.min.js"></script>
  ```
  ```javascript
  //TicTacToe is attached to window object
  var emptyBoard = new TicTacToe.TicTacToeBoard(['','','','','','','','','']);
